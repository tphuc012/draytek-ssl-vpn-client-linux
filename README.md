# DrayTek SSL VPN Client for Linux

Native Linux SSL VPN client for DrayTek routers. Connects to DrayTek's built-in SSL VPN server using the same protocol as the official Windows Smart VPN Client — no special router configuration needed.

## How It Works

The client establishes a TLS connection to the router, performs an HTTP CONNECT handshake, then negotiates a PPP tunnel using SSTP framing. Authentication supports both PAP and MS-CHAPv2. Once the PPP session is up (LCP, authentication, IPCP), a TUN device is created and IPv4 traffic flows through the encrypted tunnel.

```
TLS 1.2 → HTTP CONNECT → SSTP framing → PPP (LCP/Auth/IPCP) → IPv4 tunnel
```

The protocol implementation is a shared Rust library used by all components.

## Components

The project has two main applications and a shared protocol library:

| Component | Description | Use When |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **GUI App** | GTK4/libadwaita desktop application | You want a graphical interface to manage connections |
| **NetworkManager Plugin** | Integrates into NM as a VPN provider, includes system tray | You want VPN in GNOME Settings / `nmcli` / system-managed |
| **Protocol Library** | Shared crate implementing the full VPN protocol | Used internally by all components above |

### GUI App (`standalone/`)

A GTK4/libadwaita front end for the NetworkManager plugin. It lists the DrayTek VPN connections NM knows about, activates and deactivates them, and shows the state NM reports — along with a log view.

It **owns no tunnel**. It does not negotiate, authenticate, create TUN devices or install routes; those all belong to the NM plugin, which runs as root under NetworkManager. That means the app needs no privileges at all: no helper binary, no Polkit policy, no stored credentials. Add and edit connections in Settings → Network → VPN, where the plugin's own editor is.

The point of sharing one path is that the app, the tray and GNOME Settings all read the same connection, so they cannot disagree about whether the VPN is up. When the app ran a tunnel of its own, it reported "disconnected" while NM was connected, and offered to clean up a device NM was using.

- **Main thread** runs the GTK4/GLib event loop (UI)
- **Background thread** runs a Tokio async runtime for the NM D-Bus calls and timers

### NetworkManager Plugin (`networkmanager/`)

Integrates directly with NetworkManager so VPN connections appear alongside Wi-Fi and Ethernet in GNOME Settings, KDE, Cinnamon, or any NM frontend. NM spawns the plugin as root, so no password prompts are needed to connect.

The plugin consists of three parts:

| Part | Language | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **VPN Service** | Rust | D-Bus daemon that manages the tunnel, communicates with NM via `org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.VPN.Plugin` |
| **Editor Plugin** | C | Settings UI that loads inside `nm-connection-editor` or GNOME Settings. Ships as three `.so` files — a base plugin plus GTK3 and GTK4 editors, with runtime detection to load the right one |
| **Auth Dialog** | C | Provides the VPN password to NM when connecting |

### System Tray (`networkmanagertray/`)

A lightweight system tray indicator that monitors NetworkManager over D-Bus. Shows VPN connection status with colored icons (green = connected, red = disconnected, amber = connecting), the connected server, assigned IP address, active routes, connection duration, and traffic statistics. Automatically launches when a DrayTek VPN connects and closes when it disconnects — installed as part of `./build.sh nm install`.

### Protocol Library (`protocol/`)

Shared Rust crate that implements the full protocol stack. Used by both the GUI app and the NM plugin. The PPP finite state machine is a pure state machine — takes events in, returns actions out — making it straightforward to test.

## Prerequisites

### System dependencies

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install build-essential libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev libssl-dev pkg-config

# Additional dependencies for the NetworkManager plugin
sudo apt install libnm-dev libgtk-3-dev gcc
```

```bash
# Arch / Manjaro / EndeavourOS
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel gtk4 libadwaita openssl pkgconf rust

# Additional dependencies for the NetworkManager plugin
sudo pacman -S --needed networkmanager gtk3 glib2
```

### Rust toolchain

Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) if you don't have it:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Kernel requirements

- Linux kernel TUN/TAP support (`/dev/net/tun` must exist)

## Building & Installing

Everything is managed through `./build.sh`:

```
./build.sh <target> [action]
```

### Targets

| Target | What it builds |
|--------|----------------|
| `app` | GUI app (an NM front end) |
| `nm` | NetworkManager plugin (Rust service + C editor + C auth-dialog) |
| `tray` | System tray indicator binary (installed automatically by `nm install`, use this to rebuild the binary only) |
| `arch` | Arch Linux package via `makepkg` (wraps `packaging/arch/PKGBUILD`) |
| `all` | All of the above |

### Actions

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| *(none)* | Build debug |
| `release` | Build release (optimized) |
| `install` | Build release + install system-wide (requires sudo) |
| `run` | Build debug + launch immediately (app only) |
| `uninstall` | Remove installed files (nm, tray) |
| `deb` | Build .deb package (app, nm) |
| `appimage` | Build AppImage (app only) |
| `clean` | Remove C build artifacts |

### Examples

```bash
# Build and run the GUI app
./build.sh app run

# Build and install the NetworkManager plugin
./build.sh nm install

# Build and install the system tray indicator
./build.sh tray install

# Build + install as a native Arch package (pacman-tracked)
./build.sh arch install

# Build everything in release mode
./build.sh all release

# Install everything
./build.sh all install

# Remove the NM plugin
./build.sh nm uninstall
```

### Packaging

```bash
# Build .deb for the standalone app (uses cargo-deb)
./build.sh app deb
# → target/debian/draytek-vpn_0.1.0_amd64.deb

# Build AppImage for the standalone app
./build.sh app appimage
# → DrayTek_VPN-x86_64.AppImage

# Build .deb for the NetworkManager plugin (includes tray + XDG autostart)
./build.sh nm deb
# → target/deb-nm/draytek-vpn-nm_0.1.0_amd64.deb

# Build Arch package (.pkg.tar.zst) for the NetworkManager plugin + tray
./build.sh arch
# → packaging/arch/draytek-vpn-networkmanager-0.1.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst

# Or build + install in one shot via pacman
./build.sh arch install
```

Install a .deb with:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i target/debian/draytek-vpn_0.1.0_amd64.deb
```

See [`packaging/arch/README.md`](packaging/arch/README.md) for details on the Arch package layout and SNI tray hosts.

### Dependencies

Install build dependencies before building:

```bash
./install_dependencies.sh app    # Standalone app deps
./install_dependencies.sh nm     # NetworkManager plugin deps
./install_dependencies.sh all    # Everything
```

## Quick Start

### Option 1: GUI App

```bash
./build.sh app run
```

The app drives the NetworkManager plugin, so create the connection first — in
Settings → Network → VPN, or with `nmcli connection add` (see
[NM Configuration Keys](#networkmanager-configuration-keys)). The app's dropdown
then lists it; pick it and press Connect.

No password prompt is needed to connect. NetworkManager runs the VPN plugin as
root, and if the connection is stored with `password-flags` asking for a
secret, your desktop's secret agent supplies the password. The app never sees or
stores it.

### Option 2: NetworkManager

```bash
# Install the plugin
./build.sh nm install

# Create a connection
nmcli connection add type vpn \
    vpn-service-type org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.draytek \
    con-name "My DrayTek VPN" \
    vpn.data "gateway=vpn.example.com,port=443,username=myuser,verify-cert=no"

# Set the password
nmcli connection modify "My DrayTek VPN" vpn.secrets "password=mypassword"

# Connect
nmcli connection up "My DrayTek VPN"
```

Or use GNOME Settings / KDE / Cinnamon — "DrayTek SSL VPN" will appear as a VPN type when adding a new connection.

### System Tray (automatic with NetworkManager)

The tray indicator is installed automatically by `./build.sh nm install`. It launches when a DrayTek VPN connects and closes when it disconnects — no separate install needed.

To rebuild just the tray binary (e.g. after code changes):

```bash
./build.sh tray install
```

## NetworkManager Configuration Keys

These go in `vpn.data` when creating a connection via `nmcli`:

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `gateway` | *(required)* | VPN server hostname or IP |
| `port` | `443` | Server port |
| `username` | *(required)* | VPN username |
| `verify-cert` | `no` | Verify server TLS certificate (`yes`/`no`) |
| `mru` | `0` (auto) | MRU to propose during LCP negotiation |
| `route-remote-network` | `yes` | Auto-route the remote gateway's /24 subnet |
| `never-default` | `yes` | Don't replace the default route with the VPN |
| `keepalive` | `no` | Enable ICMP keepalive pings |
| `routes` | *(empty)* | Additional routes in CIDR notation, comma-separated (e.g. `10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12`) |

Password is stored in `vpn.secrets` under the key `password`.
